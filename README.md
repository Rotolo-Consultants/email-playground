## email playground with react email from the team @ Resend

npm install

then cd into react-email-starter

npm install again...(i fucked up the project structure) 

feel free to add whatever components from https://react.email/components/


you can use tailwind (just wrap the component with <Tailwind>  </Tailwind>

or you can use CSS and just apply it to the components 
const cssVariable = {
  'height: '100px', 
  }

<SomeComponent styles={{cssVariable}}>
