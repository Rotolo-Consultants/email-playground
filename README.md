## email playground with react email from the team @ Resend

## contributing
just push to main 😈🤝
i've been making tweaks to the files in components/ 
so if u use one just make a duplicate version so my changes don't fuck up anything ☠️
only component that's about ready is the emails/take-two.tsx


## feedback component
https://react.email/components/feedback

npm install

then cd into react-email-starter

npm install again...(i fucked up the project structure) 

feel free to add whatever components from https://react.email/components/


you can use tailwind (just wrap the component with ``<Tailwind>  </Tailwind>``

or you can use CSS and just apply it to the components 
```
<SomeComponent styles={{cssVariable}}>

const cssVariable = {
  'height: '100px', 
  }
```
